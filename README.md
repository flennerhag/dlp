# Deep Learning Playground

This repo contains a simple deep learning library design for educational purposes. The software is CPU based, runs forward passes and backpropagations with JIT compiled functions.
To run any of the experiments, copy any any of the scripts in the [experiments](experiments) folder to the main directory and execute. 

```bash
cp experiments/MNIST.py . 
python MNIST.py
```
