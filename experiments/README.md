# Experiments

This folder contains a set of simple experiments.

- [test_graph](test_graph.py) checks that the computational graph behaves as expected on a simple feed forward network.
- [test_sgd](test_sgd.py) fits a deep feed-forward network to the make_classification problem of Scikit-learn. Various optimization options are available, along with network sizes. The training outputs a learning evolution graph.
