# Experiments

These experiments are design to highlight how key features in deep learning behave.

- [test_graph](test_graph.py) checks that the computational graph behaves as expected on a simple feed forward network.
- [SGD](SGD.py) comparison of the most popular optimization algorithms for a deep feed-forward network fitted on the ``make_classification`` problem of Scikit-learn.
- [MNIST](MNIST.py) fits a deep neural net to the MNIST dataset.
